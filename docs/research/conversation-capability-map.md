# Conversation capability coverage

This map compares the Rocket Agents ecosystem with the observable capabilities
of [Historious](https://github.com/nikvdp/historious) at
`9b9f26fb9e9d52882be55d76880d1623021a22e4` and
[ai-data-extraction](https://github.com/0xSero/ai-data-extraction) at
`b7520c48b2bb46d5a0d3257e80ca1a59670d5e37`. It records capability coverage, not
code lineage; the implementation in this repository is independent.

## Baseline differences

The strict BusiRocket baseline adds controls that neither reference defines as
the transport contract: atomic exported units, TypeScript strictness including
unchecked-index and exact-optional checks, architectural import boundaries,
secret redaction, traversal rejection, size limits, allowlisted SQLite tables,
content manifests, mode-0600 files, dry-run mutation gates, full project checks,
home-path redaction, and explicit supply-chain policy in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
Node 22.13 is enforced so SQLite-backed adapters use the built-in read-only
driver instead of shell interpolation or an additional native dependency.

## Acceptance boundary

Feature parity is measured at the Rocket Agents ecosystem boundary, not by
reproducing every command name from a monolithic reference. Transport, indexing,
knowledge organization, agent integration, and machine scheduling keep separate
owners. A capability counts as covered only when its owning component has a
runnable verification command.
